/**
 * Trying to intercept the selection process to not cancel an edit.
 *
 * Issues:
 * - the control of editing is centered completely inside the cell itself
 * - there's no way to get hold of the actual editing cell, it's only the
 * TablePosition of the cell that's available
 * - on mousePressed (actually simpleSelect) this behaviour is playing
 * squash: the table is the wall, the target is the editing fellow cell
 * whose edit is rudely cancelled
 * - with the current api, this behaviour can't do much better: table's
 * api is too weak, one method only
 * - hack here: add api to tableView that supports the notion of
 * terminate an edit and use it (note: needs cooperation of all cells
 * in the table)
 * - astonished: _why_ the need to cancel (or otherwise end an edit anywhere
 * outside this cell) - shouldn't the selection/focus update automagically
 * trigger the other cell to update its editing?
 *
 * Didn't compile in jdk8_u20 (joy of hacking ;-) :
 * - simpleSelect method signature changed
 * - edit handling at the end of former simpleSelect was extracted
 * to handleClicks (method in CellBehaviour, probably good move for
 * consistency across across cell containers)
 * - so now we override the latter and try terminate edits
 *
